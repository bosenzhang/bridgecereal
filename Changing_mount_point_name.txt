## Step-1: List Mounted Partitions with Mount Points

df -hP

## Step-2: List processes accessing mount point

fuser -cu /mnt/946c1663-fcbd-4a78-8887-c55f23c5b496

## Step-3: Unmount mount point

umount /dev/sda or umount /mnt/946c1663-fcbd-4a78-8887-c55f23c5b496

## Step-4: Change Mount Point Name

# Use the mkdir command to create the new mount point:

mkdir /mnt/newname ?

# Then remount the partition to this new mount point:

mount /dev/sda /mnt/newname

# When you list the mount points again, you can see the new directory.
